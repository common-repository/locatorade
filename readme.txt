Hands down the most flexible location search and store finder available for WordPress today.

== Description ==

Do you need to setup a location search / store finder on your WordPress site? You're in luck. 

This plugin allows you to add locations quickly and easily. To setup the search, just add the 'Locatorade Search' widget to the sidebar and you're up and running.

A PRO version of Locatorade is also available at http://locatorade.com/ which includes mass importing of locations (using a CSV file), granular control over pin icons and much, much more!

== Installation ==

1. Get a Google Maps API key [ http://http://code.google.com/apis/maps/signup.html ]
2. Install Locatorade like any other plugin
3. A location search page is automatically generated.
4. Go to Locatorade Settings and add your Google Maps API key.
5. Go to Add Locations and begin adding locations.
6. You can modify the distance type (miles/kilometres), the default pin icon, your location search theme, and more from the settings page.
